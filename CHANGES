2017-03-30  JMB  Update UI translations, fix them on Android

    Updated the UI translation files, and fixed a configuration bug which was
    preventing them from being used on Android.

2017-03-29  JMB  Add help action to Android, visual fixes

    Added a "Help" action to Android which points to the online help files
    in the appropriate language.

    Changed the default Android alternate row background color to one which
    is easier to distinguish, and removed some padding on dynamic-height
    text inputs which was causing the cursor to be mis-positioned.

2017-03-28  JMB  Fix image selector/editor on Android

    The image selection/editing dialog hadn't been properly tested on
    Android yet; made a couple of fixes to make it work correctly.

2017-03-27  JMB  More reliable column resizing

    At least on Android, setting the width of a column from the column
    statistics dialog triggered a cascade of events which could sometimes
    inadvertently change the widths of other columns also.  Disabled a signal
    hander while applying changes from the dialog to prevent this from
    happening.

2017-03-24  JMB  Better slideshow mode

    Switched over slideshows to use the image viewer dialog which was
    just refactored.

2017-03-22  JMB  Better image fullscreen mode

    PortaBase was still using a hack for fullscreen image display that
    predated the addition of proper fullscreen support in Qt, and at
    least with Qt 5 it sometimes resulted in odd failures to return to
    normal display mode.  Switched over to the same approach used for
    the main window's fullscreen mode.

2017-03-20  JMB  Removed image resolution limit

    All of PortaBase's supported platforms now have much more RAM than
    the original Sharp Zaurus (and Qt has gotten better about downscaling
    PNG images while loading), so the 800x600 resolution cap no longer
    makes sense.  The limit has been removed; images smaller than the
    screen resolution are shown at their actual size, and larger ones are
    scaled down to fit on the screen.  This means, for example, that digital
    photos can now be stored in a PortaBase file and (if the file wasn't
    explicitly altered in the image editor when selecting it) exported out
    again with no quality loss and all metadata intact.  Note, however,
    that Metakit's 1 GB file size limit significantly constrains the
    number of high-resolution photos you can fit in a single PortaBase file.

2017-03-19  JMB  More recent files remembered

    Increased the number of recent files shown in the File menu and on
    the file selection screen from 5 to 10.  Also abbreviated the text
    on the file import button to better fit in portrait mode on Android
    phones.

2017-03-17  JMB  Dynamically update fullscreen action text

    The fullscreen action now changes the text in menus and tooltips
    appropriately after it has been activated (to say "Exit Fullscreen"
    instead of "Fullscreen", etc.).  Additionally, I'd overlooked that
    a small checkbox was been shown next to the text in the menu on
    Android devices; suppressed that now that the action's text is
    more appropriate.

2017-03-16  JMB  Updated source code documentation

    Upgraded Doxygen and its configuration files, and fixed some problems
    it found with the source code documentation comments.

2017-03-11  JMB  Added Android port

    Added support for running PortaBase on Android 4.4 (KitKat) and above.
    It works well enough for my own daily use, but I want to go through
    a short beta testing period before releasing it to the app store; let
    me know if you're interested in trying it out and providing feedback.

2017-02-04  JMB  Upgraded Metakit to 2.4.9.8

    Updated the bundled version of Metakit to the latest code from GitHub
    (this fixes a problem with compiling it for Android).

2017-01-16  JMB  More translation file updates

    My last pull of updated translations from Transiex missed some of the
    recent updates to existing translations.  Everything that's been
    translated there should now also be in the source code.

2017-01-11  JMB  Better alternating row color defaults, CSV enums import

    The background colors for alternate rows in the data viewer and
    other grids had been defaulting to white and light gray, but now
    use the appropriate colors from the current native theme unless other
    values have been specified.  Similarly, the row viewer had been
    hardcoded to use light gray as the alternate row background color,
    but the color from the preferences dialog is now used.  There is also
    now a "Reset" button in the dialog to revert to the current system
    default colors.

    Also, I discovered that I hadn't quite finished support for optionally
    importing new enum values during CSV import with the initial commit back
    in 2013; it is now finished and tested.

2017-01-09  JMB  Added Italian UI translation, updated translation files

    A new Italian translation has been contributed by Maurizio Codogno.
    Also fetched the latest updates for other languages from Transifex.

2016-12-24  JMB  Added Qt 5 support, native Mac toolbar

    Added support for Qt 5 to get the latest fixes for actively supported
    platforms and enable ports to new ones, without yet dropping Qt 4
    support (needed for Maemo devices).

    Used and extended QMacToolBar to get a native toolbar on Mac OS X,
    complete with the usual customization options.

2015-10-11  JMB  Automated Fremantle builds, fixed cppcheck findings

    Added the packaging/maemo/fremantle_vm.sh script to automate Maemo
    Fremantle builds, similar to the one already done for Diablo.

    Automated execution of the "cppcheck" static code analysis utility and
    fixed the potential issues it reported.

2015-10-04  JMB  Added Maemo Diablo build script using VM

    Added the packaging/maemo/diablo_vm.sh script to fully automate builds
    of the Maemo Diablo version of PortaBase, launching and closing the
    development virtual machine as necessary.

2015-07-27  JMB  Fixed bugs in handling of new src dir

    Fixed a few bugs in the updated copy_source.sh script.

2015-07-19  JMB  Moved source code under src directory

    From the early days when PortaBase was a much smaller program, the main
    source code files have always been in the project root directory. This is
    no longer appropriate now that the number of files has grown and the
    repository is being hosted on GitHub where this structure is burying the
    README well down the page. Created a "src" directory, moved the source
    files into it, and updated all scripts to cope with the new
    organizational structure.

2015-07-07  JMB  Replaced usage of deprecated date-setting method

    Replace usage of the deprecated QDate.setYMD() with setDate() in order to
    prepare for Qt 5 support.

2013-10-06  JMB  More CSV import/export options from command line

    Added several improvements to the import and export of CSV files from the
    command line: more file encodings, support for tab-delimited files, the
    option to export with Windows line endings, support for parsing and
    writing files with an initial row of column headers, and the option to
    automatically add new enum options encountered instead of treating them as
    validation errors.  The UI will get support for the new options soon.

2013-10-01  JMB  Fixed icon in Mac 'About PortaBase' dialog

    On the Mac, the 'About PortaBase' dialog was picking up the title bar's
    document icon; fixed to use the application icon instead.

2012-09-19  JMB  Mac universal binary build update

    Minor fix to automated building of 32-bit Intel/PPC universal binaries.

2012-09-18  JMB  Row viewer sorting bugfix

    Fixed a bug where the row viewer sorting could become incorrect when
    changing to a different view while a one-column sorting was in effect
    (it was sorting on the same column index in the view, but that could
    be a different column after the change).

2012-09-10  JMB  Maemo packaging fixes

    Added mce-dev to the list of build dependencies used by the Maemo
    autobuilders; needed for keeping the display on throughout a slideshow.
    Also updated the base64-encoded application icon data in the Maemo
    package control files.

2012-09-08  #################### PortaBase 2.1 ####################

2012-09-08  JMB  French translation update, updates for 2.1 release

    Added the latest translations of the help files into French, and updated
    the last few files in preparation for the 2.1 release.

2012-08-28  JMB  Row deletion bugfix, Mac icons and retina display support

    Fixed a bug where deleting a row from the row viewer would delete the
    row it was first launched for, not necessarily the one it was currently
    showing.  Also updated a few instaces of the application icon on the Mac
    that I missed when first swapping it.  Enabled high-resolution text
    rendering on retina displays (higher resolution icon display has to wait
    for support in Qt).

    Added the latest update to the French translation of the help files, and
    made some changes to ensure that the updated translations of Sphinx
    phrases are fully utilized in the help files.

2012-08-24  JMB  Translation updates, Mac code signing

    Incorporated the latest text updates from all the translators.  Added a
    work-in-progress simplified Chinese translation by Fiona Zhao.  Support
    for simplified Chinese and Slovak in the Windows installer.
    
    Added support for code signing in the Mac build script in order to be
    treated as a more legitimate application by Gatekeeper in Mountain Lion.

2012-08-20  JMB  N900 crash fix

    Hopefully a final fix for the N900 crash I was occasionally experiencing,
    by completely replacing the HTML display widget used for that platform.
    Working fine so far after a week of testing.

2012-08-12  JMB  New application icon

    Switched to a new application icon designed specifically for PortaBase by
    Holly Guenther (http://kimchikawaii.deviantart.com).  Some of my upcoming
    plans for PortaBase work best if it has a unique and distinctive icon
    rather than the previous one borrowed from Wikipedia (or the one before
    that borrowed from KDE).

2012-08-06  JMB  Support for signing Windows binaries

    Updated the windows build scripts to support digitally signing the program
    binary, installer, and uninstaller.  This should tone down the warning
    messages shown on Vista and higher when installing future PortaBase
    releases.

2012-07-31  JMB  Added Sphinx translation files, more packaging fixes

    Added the localization files for Sphinx itself so they can be translated
    for PortaBase along with everything else.  Included a few search-related
    phrases currently missing in the upstream files due to a bug.
    
    Fixed more packaging bugs (Debian source format version, detecting the
    correct language for help files, building the help files on Windows, etc.)
    Added some more information to the build instructions (INSTALL, etc.)

2012-07-29  JMB  Proper internationalization of help pages

    Reworked how the help files are generated so that the translations for
    them can be managed online with Transifex just like the UI translations.
    Updated the build scripts accordingly.

2012-07-26  JMB  Updated UI translation files, Transifex setup

    Got the translation files ready for the translators to update for the next
    release.  Mapped the files to the PortaBase translation project on
    Transifex.

2012-07-23  JMB  More HTML display fixes, build script updates

    Fixed the new code for HTML display widgets to correctly display the top
    of the content first (if there's enough to cause scrolling).  Made more
    improvements to the build scripts, mostly for Windows.

2012-07-21  JMB  Fixed N900 bugs, made packaging improvements

    Fixed a bug where the column statistics dialog didn't have the correct
    parent widget set when launched via the file properties dialog (mostly a
    problem on Maemo Fremantle, where this affects the dialog transition
    animation).  Also changed the way content gets added to HTML display
    widgets (such as the row viewer, the file properties dialog, and the
    column statistics dialog) in an attempt to work around a Qt bug which
    seems to cause intermittent crashes only on the N900.
    
    Moved the help files in the Fremantle package to the /opt partition so
    they don't consume limited space in the root partition.  Made assorted
    improvements to the build scripts so they don't require as much manual
    fiddling with each release (read version number from one file, etc.)

2012-07-19  JMB  Fixed column sorting and title bar bugs, fixed help on Maemo

    Fixed a recently-introduced bug where clicking on a column header to sort
    by that column would also show the column statistics dialog.  Also fixed
    a bug where the title bar wasn't always reflecting correctly if there were
    unsaved changes or not.  Fixed the Maemo packaging to correctly locate the
    new help files.

2012-07-18  JMB  Mac build updates, better language detection, install docs

    Updated the Mac build scripts to reflect Apple's current recommendations
    and the realities of compiling on Lion with Xcode 4.  Also updated the
    code for selecting the UI language to display based on changes in Qt 4.8
    which do a better job at providing the correct language settings from the
    system.  Updated the translation files to include phrases recently added
    to the Qt framework.

    Also broke out the platform-specific sections of the INSTALL file into
    their own files, which should make it easier to understand the build
    instructions.

2012-06-18  JMB  Added Slovak UI translation

    Added a Slovak translation of the user interface (provided by Slavko).

2012-06-17  JMB  Updated .desktop file for Linux packaging

    Removed the deprecated "Encoding" key to comply with the current
    specification.

2012-02-04  JMB  Fixed condition editor operators for sequence fields

    Fixed a bug where the condition editor used the list of string-type
    operators for sequence fields rather than the numeric ones.

2011-02-02  JMB  Improved help pages, updated man page

    Changed the help content from a monolithic HTML page in a modal dialog
    to an easily-navigated set of smaller pages with search functionality,
    launched in the system's default browser.  Updated the man page to include
    HTML export capability.

2011-01-16  JMB  Faster "delete rows in filter", organized copyright info

    Improved the speed of deleting all rows in the current filter.  Updated
    the copyright file for the Debian package to conform to current standards
    and fully describe the copyright and licensing of all files in the source
    distribution.

2011-01-15  JMB  Allow HTML export from the command line, fixed XML import bug

    Allow export to HTML to be done from the command line just like exporting
    to CSV or XML.  Also updated XML import to allow for the possibility of
    booleans columns being referenced in calculated fields.

2011-01-13  JMB  HTML export

    Added the option to export to an HTML file (the results look much like the
    printing output).

2011-01-12  JMB  Better properties dialog, translation updates, theme bugfix

    Improved the file properties dialog, including a button to launch the
    column statistics dialog.  Made some updates to the UI translation files.
    Added an option to disable alternating row shading on Fremantle so that
    themes with poor choices of a second color don't look bad (the default
    theme uses the same color for all rows).

2011-01-11  JMB  Better column widths and statistics, Fremantle auto-rotate

    Appended a 0-width empty column to the data table to soak up any extra
    space (useful for right-aligned last columns, and fixes a bug where a
    newly opened file could inherit the width of the previous file's last
    column).  Improved the appearance of the column statistics dialog and gave
    it a widget to control the column's width in pixels.  Added a preferences
    option to enable auto-rotation of the entire application on Fremantle.

2011-01-10  JMB  Fremantle image rotation, adjustable row height

    Allow fullscreen images on Fremantle (including slideshows) to
    auto-rotate with the device orientation.  Also added a preference to allow
    the data table row height to adjust to the font size on Fremantle
    (allowing more rows on the screen but making them harder to accurately tap
    with fingers).

2011-01-09  JMB  Removed row double-clicking, better Maemo backlight handling

    Removed the behavior to show the row viewer when double-clicking on a row
    in the data table; it was interacting badly with the single-click behavior
    and was only one of many ways of launching the row viewer.  The backlight
    on Maemo devices now won't dim or turn off during a slideshow.  Also made
    sure that an earlier fix for improving integer input on Fremantle PR1.2
    won't break on PR1.3.

2011-01-07  JMB  Fremantle checkbox bugfixes, cppcheck warning fixes

    Fixed some erratic checkbox functionality (especially in lists on
    Fremantle) in the columns editor, sorting editor, and view editor.  Also
    fixed a few spots in the code which triggered warnings in cppcheck.

2011-01-01  JMB  Doxygen updates, Windows build fixes

    Made some improvements to the Doxygen documentation generation process and
    content.  Fixed some bugs that crept up in the Windows build since the
    2.0 release.

2010-12-30  JMB  Decimal formatting, view model, and condition editor bugfixes

    Fixed a bug that prevented negative decimals between 0 and -1 from being
    entered, another that could sometimes trigger a crash when a row was
    edited so that it no longer passed the current filter, and a third that
    prevented the condition editor from being correctly initialized when
    starting with a condition based on an enum column.

2010-12-16  JMB  Allow boolean columns in calculations

    Boolean columns can now be used in calculations; they take the value of
    either 1 (true) or 0 (false).

2010-11-14  JMB  Fixed bugs in number formatting

    Fixed a couple of outstanding bugs that impacted locales which use the
    the period as an integer grouping separator.

2010-10-28  JMB  More intuitive import dialog sequence

    The sequence of dialogs when importing a MobileDB or XML file now makes
    more sense; the user is prompted first for the file to import, then for
    the name of the new file to create.

2010-10-27  JMB  Build instructions update, translation files cleanup

    Mentioned the need to prepare the translation files in the compilation
    instructions.  Removed some extraneous empty "location" elements in the
    Qt translation files that were causing Pootle (a translation server I'm in
    the process of setting up) to choke.

2010-08-16  JMB  Note button sizing fix, more info in file properties dialog

    Fixed the width of note field edit buttons representing long text on
    Fremantle.  Added the number of rows in the current filter and the number
    of columns in the current view to the file properties dialog.

2010-08-15  JMB  French translation update, main window code cleanup

    Added a recently received update to the French UI translation.  Moved a lot
    of code for the main window to a separate base class, which has already
    been tested and refined in another project of mine; fixes a minor issue
    with the save changes prompt dialog.

2010-08-14  JMB  Condition editor enum enhancement, clear recent files button

    If you switch from one column to another one of the same enum type in the
    condition editor, the selected value is no longer reset to the first one
    in the list (this was really bothering me in a transactions database where
    the "To" and "From" columns use the same enum).
    
    Added a button in the "Appearance" tab of the preferences dialog to clear
    the list of recently opened files.

2010-08-13  JMB  Calculator backspace/clear fix, better Fremantle integer input

    Fixed a bug where clicking backspace or the clear button in the calculator
    dialog could result in incorrect display of grouping separators.  Enabled
    function lock on integer entry widgets in Fremantle, so input is easier
    using the hardware keyboard (although this precludes group separators, and
    wouldn't work for decimal values either).

2010-06-08  JMB  XML import bugfix, default decimal string fix

    Fixed a bug where XML files would fail to import if the current filter
    was specified as anything other than the "all rows" filter.  Fixed the
    initial default value for decimal columns to use the appropriate decimal
    point character for the locale in use.

2010-06-03  JMB  Packaging fix for Fremantle

    Fixed a problem with the packaging for Fremantle that was causing
    installation to fail near completion (the link to the binary wasn't always
    managed properly).

2010-06-02  #################### PortaBase 2.0 ####################

2010-06-02  JMB  Fremantle condition editor fix, updated version number

    Fixed a bug on Fremantle where launching the date picker dialog from the
    condition editor would confuse the back/close button logic in the app
    thereafter.  Updated version numbers for the next release.

2010-05-29  JMB  Recent files update fix

    Fixed a bug where an invalid entry was added to the recently opened files
    list when importing a MobileDB or XML file.

2010-05-27  #################### PortaBase 2.0rc1 ####################

2010-05-27  JMB  Japanese update, accelerator clash fix, dropped file fix

    Updated the Japanese translation of the help file (fixing a few minor
    issues with the UI translation and the English help file in the process).
    Both "Preferences" and "Edit Enums" in the File menu were using the "E"
    accelerator, switched the latter to use "N".  Also accounted for the
    possibility of dropping files which don't have the extension all in lower
    case.  Updated version numbers for the next release.

2010-05-25  JMB  Fixed file creation bug, stale filter bug

    Fixed a rather serious bug introduced by the support for read-only files,
    which prevented any new files from being created.  Also fixed a bug where
    the current filter might contain stale data after major format changes.

2010-05-24  JMB  Chinese & Czech updates, Debian/Maemo description updates

    Added the updated Chinese and Czech UI translations, and the Chinese help
    file translation.  Made another attempt to fix the package description on
    the Maemo package web page.

2010-05-19  JMB  Read-only encrypted files, print pages filter, translations

    Fixed a bug where read-only encrypted files were erroneously showing as
    saveable.  Fixed the print preview dialog so it no longer restricts you to
    the last set of pages chosen for printing.  Updated all the translation
    files with a few new phrases.

2010-05-17  #################### PortaBase 2.0b2 ####################

2010-05-17  JMB  Sorting editor bugfix, updated version number

    Fixed a bug in the sorting editor where ascending/descending labels were
    initially reversed.  Also updated the version number in all appropriate
    places for the next beta release.

2010-05-15  JMB  Assorted bugfixes

    Read-only files can now be opened correctly, with a dialog warning the user
    that they will not be able to save any changes made.  Also added better
    recognition of and error messages for assorted file handling problems
    (trying to open a file that doesn't exist or the user doesn't have read
    access to, trying to overwrite a file that the user doesn't have write
    permission for, etc.)

    Fixed a bug that prevented slideshows from working (introduced by an
    earlier fix for a memory leak).  Exclude "None" dates and times from column
    statistic min/max calculations when there are any other values present.
    Pressing the left or right arrows in the row editor was sometimes causing
    both the intended change in the displayed row and an additional change in
    focus of the buttons at the bottom of the dialog; fixed to have just the
    desired effect.  Set tab stop widths in the note editor to be the same as
    in earlier versions of PortaBase (the width of 8 'x' characters in the
    current font).

2010-05-13  JMB  Fixed corner case bug in adding a new row

    Squashed another bug introduced by the model/view conversion: if you added
    a new row (or copied an existing one) while a filter was applied, and the
    new row passed the filter, the screen refreshed in such a way that you
    might not see the full set of rows passing the filter.

2010-05-12  JMB  Tweaked calculator & date dialogs, package descriptions

    Moved the calculator dialog's "OK" button to the right place on Fremantle.
    Don't maximize the calendar dialog on Diablo; it seems to force several
    slow resizings, and still doesn't come out quite right.  Updated the
    bulleted lists in the Diablo and Maemo package descriptions to use current
    Debian conventions, which should improve the text formatting on the Maemo
    package web page.

2010-05-11  JMB  Assorted bugfixes, formatting code cleanup, better Mac dmg

    Fixed a bug in opening PortaBase files from the command line.  That bug
    also broke opening files with a double-click on Windows and Linux, so that
    should work again.

    The recently used files list now ensures that the last opened file is at
    the top of the list, not just in it.  Also made sure that files opened from
    the command line or drag & drop get included in the list.
    
    Made the height of string input fields more consistent.  Moved more data
    field formatting and parsing code to the new Formatting class.  Made some
    minor enhancements to the Mac installer disk image build script.

2010-05-10  JMB  Number formatting improvements, usability tweaks, Czech update

    Overhauled the formatting and parsing of decimal values so that they should
    look correct in most locales, without actually changing what's stored in
    the file (internally, US English number formatting is always used).  This
    had some side benefits, like being able to enter percentages and have them
    used correctly in calculations.  CSV import/export still assumes US English
    formatting, I'll try to fix that as part of a larger CSV import overhaul in
    version 2.1.
    
    Changed the date dialog so that clicking "Today" or clicking (or selecting
    with the "Enter" or "Return" keys) a day will immediately select the date
    and close the dialog.  Changed the default decimal default value in the
    column editor from "0" to "0.0" so as to make it easier to distinguish from
    integer fields.  Updated the Czech UI translation and added a Czech help
    file translation (both from 1.9; the 2.0 versions are being worked on).

2010-05-07  JMB  XML & MobileDB import fixed, integer field validation fixed

    Fixed a couple of bugs that were preventing XML and MobileDB import from
    working.  Also fixed a bug where entering a decimal value into an integer
    field would accept it as the value "0".

2010-05-05  #################### PortaBase 2.0b1 ####################

2010-05-05  JMB  Windows updates, packaging tweaks, translation tools

    Updated the Windows-specific parts of portabase.pro.  Fixed a bug in
    imageselector.cpp that broke compiling with MinGW.  Updated the application
    icon for Windows and the Inno Setup installer script.  Created a couple of
    batch scripts to automate compilation and creation of the installer.
    Updated the INSTALL file with current instructions for building on Windows.
    Made some minor packaging fixes for Debian and Maemo.

    There's now a trio of environment variables that can be used to test out
    PortaBase UI and help file translations: PORTABASE_QM, PORTABASE_QT_QM, and
    PORTABASE_HELP.  I'll document their usage fully on the web site with the
    notes on doing translations.  Clarified the encoding (UTF-8) of the
    existing help files and updated the UI translation files while I was at it.

2010-05-02  JMB  Help file update, more Maemo and usability improvements

    Updated the English help file to match the current state of the code.
    Added a note to the file properties dialog about how to access the column
    statistics dialog.  Fixed a bug in launching the column statistics dialog
    on Fremantle.  Fixed the appearance of the password and slideshow dialogs
    on Maemo.  Added a missing include for PBDialog that might cause compiling
    problems on some platforms.

2010-04-30  JMB  Proper D-Bus support, more bugfixes and Maemo improvements

    Added code to correctly register with D-Bus on Maemo; this allows PortaBase
    to be launched by clicking on a file in the file manager, ensures that only
    one copy of PortaBase is open, and prevents PortaBase from crashing shortly
    after being launched from the menu.
    
    Moved the "None" date button from the row editor to the date picker dialog,
    allowing long dates to fit comfortably even on smaller screens.  Fixed a
    recently-introduced bug in the toggling of column sorting directions.  Use
    space more efficiently for dialog buttons on Diablo.  Clean up files in the
    recently used list after they're discovered to no longer exist.  Added an
    import toolbar button.  Hide the redundant new/open/import buttons on Maemo
    once there's a recent files list, in order to save screen space.  Alternate
    row shading in the row viewer, and kinetic scrolling for it in Fremantle.
    Use screen space a little more efficiently in the Maemo version of the view
    editor dialog.  Made image icons in the data table a little bigger for
    Maemo.  Prepared a few files for the upcoming beta release.

2010-04-29  JMB  More Fremantle improvements, added some help text

    Fixed the height of several widgets so they look correct on Fremantle.
    Fixed the calculator dialog display background color.  Better checkbox
    appearance in data tables.  Text in the data rows is now vertically
    centered.  Fixed button placement in the column editor dialog.  Cleaner
    layout for the condition editor dialog.  Removed redundant text from date
    displays in the row editor.  Fixed the appearance of note field buttons in
    the row editor.  Moved the standard add/edit/delete/up/down buttons to the
    side button panel.  Use larger icons on Fremantle to accomodate the larger
    buttons.  Fixed the input field widths in the time editing widget.  Fixed
    the dialog stack back button chain when editing a row.
    
    In a change not specific to the Fremantle UI, I added some help text to the
    database format, enum manager, and enum editor dialogs when they contain
    no data.  This should make it a little easier to understand how to get
    started when creating a new file.

2010-04-27  JMB  Fremantle improvements, bugfixes

    Use stacked windows on Maemo Fremantle for more screen real estate and a
    more native look.  Put dialog buttons on the right side where they should
    be for Fremantle.  No alternating row colors preference on Fremantle, since
    Qt delegates that to the GTK+ theme.  The preferences dialog in Fremantle
    now uses a large scrolling panel rather than multiple tabs.  Fixed another
    model/view bug (display wasn't updating correctly when the number of rows
    in the filter went from 0 to 1).  Put the start page buttons in a
    scrollable view so they don't get squished in Maemo.  Don't maximize the
    help dialog on non-Maemo platforms.

2010-04-21  JMB  Updated Debian packaging, yet more bugfixes

    Tested and debugged the Debian packaging; now passes lintian cleanly.
    Fixed a column sizing bug introduced by the new model/view design for the
    main data grid.  Resolved a couple of minor memory issues revealed by
    Valgrind.  Updated the Metakit patch to resolve a warning generated by
    recent versions of gcc.  Simplified the Filter class to resolve a possible
    bug involving pointer sizes.  Fixed a syntax bug in some of the Mac
    localization files.

2010-04-20  JMB  Diablo packaging fixes, more bugfixes

    Tested and fixed the Maemo packaging, such that it can now cleanly generate
    a package for Diablo.  Patched the random number generator library to
    seed itself from /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random so it doesn't hang
    due to lack of entropy.  Disabled column reordering on the main data grid
    widget (that's best done with views).  Aspect ratios are now preserved
    again for images shown in a slideshow, and on Maemo images are shown
    centered in a consistently maximized dialog for viewing.

2010-04-19  JMB  Maemo packaging, updated Debian packaging, bugfixes

    First attempt at proper Maemo packaging (for both Diablo and Fremantle),
    and updated the Debian packaging in the process.  As part of this, the
    already-patched Metakit source code is now included in the PortaBase
    source code; this should make things easier for anybody building PortaBase
    from source.  Still testing the packaging work, but it should be almost
    finished.

    Fixed a bug in the new code for updating the display after editing a row
    or toggling a boolean value.  Dialogs should now fill the appropriate width
    in Maemo, even in fullscreen mode.  Adjusted the toolbar spacing on Maemo
    to fit in better and be more finger-friendly.  Also, opening a PortaBase
    file from the command line no longer requires a "-f" flag.

2010-04-15  JMB  Large table scrolling performance, fullscreen mode, etc.

    PortaBase now properly uses Qt 4's model/view architecture to enable good
    performance even when scrolling through a data table with thousands of
    rows.  (It should do well with hundreds of columns also, but I haven't
    tested that yet.)  This means that pagination is no longer a requirement
    for good performance on large files, but it's still available as an option
    because it can be useful for eliminating the vertical scrollbar in cases
    where horizontal space is at a premium.
    
    I added a fullscreen mode, activated by a button on the toolbar; this was
    primarily for Maemo, but works on other platforms as well.  I also made a
    lot of buttons look better on Maemo, fixed a couple of bugs in the image
    editor, removed the "What's This?" button from dialog title bars, and
    improved the layout of the column editor.

2010-04-12  JMB  Dialogs for view, sorting, and filter management; Maemo menu

    There are now dialogs for selecting, creating, editing, and deleting views,
    sortings, and filters.  These are launched via toolbar buttons, and are the
    only way to access this functionality on Maemo (the menus used until now
    have been left intact on the desktop versions for the time being).  This
    should be a little more intuitive to use, especially for Maemo users.
    This also made it possible to reduce the number of menu items to 10, which
    is good for Maemo 5.

2010-04-10  JMB  Launch the row viewer with a single click, more buttons on it

    The row viewer is now launched with a single click on a row in the data
    grid by default (this can be disabled in the preferences dialog).  The
    reason for this is that there are now buttons in the row viewer for all
    the actions that can be performed on a selected row; this seems more
    natural for a Maemo application, and will help free up some space on the
    main toolbar for other things that don't require a row to be selected
    first.  Also fixed a formatting bug introduced to the row editor by the
    last commit.

2010-03-31  JMB  Integer formatting, other minor fixes

    Displayed integers now use separators as appropriate for the locale.
    Imported and entered integers also accept strings with separators
    appropriate for the locale.  Integers in data exported to CSV or XML
    exclude these separators, since they aren't portable between locales.  Also
    made a fix to ensure that English still gets used for the UI when
    appropriate, and added a few icons to be used in an upcoming feature.

2010-03-24  JMB  Printing, translation updates, data column alignment

    PortaBase now supports printing, including page setup and print preview
    (this is omitted on Maemo and other platforms which don't provide any kind
    of printing functionality).  Also reworked the code to take advantage of
    translation work that's already been done for Qt, fully updated the
    Japanese UI translation, and got the other UI translations ready for
    translators to update (the phrases that have already been translated should
    still appear correctly, but there are a number of new ones as well).
    I made sure that the translations are being used correctly on Mac OS X
    (including the application menu, which requires some special handling).
    I also made a minor change regarding column alignment in the data viewer:
    numeric fields are now right-aligned so they line up better.

2010-03-15  JMB  Initial Maemo support, code cleanup, release preparation work

    I got PortaBase to build in the Maemo (Diablo) SDK, so I've started fixing
    things that look bad in that environment.  In the process, I reworked a
    lot of the layout code to be more consistent with spacing and margins.
    I also fixed an assortment of mostly harmless bugs that were revealed by
    the Eclipse-based ESbox IDE.  Assorted other packaging work in preparation
    for a release: updated the Metakit patch to work with the latest release,
    started updating the UI translation files, and made a lot of updates to the
    build instructions (still needs some work).

2010-03-09  JMB  Start screen buttons, row editor focus, code comments

    Added convenience buttons to the screen shown when no file is currently
    open; these make it a little faster to create and open files, and make it
    a little more obvious for new users what to do first.  Changed the row
    editor so that the first text input field (if any) gets keyboard focus as
    soon as the dialog is shown (so you can immediately start typing, and use
    tabs to select other fields).  Also finished writing code comments for
    use with Doxygen and updated some copyright year statements.

2010-03-07  JMB  File decryption, condition editor layout, GCC warnings

    Fixed a bug in decrypting encrypted files that crept in when I eliminated
    the dependency on BeeCrypt.  Updated the condition editor to adjust the
    length of the operation selection list when its content changes (by
    selecting a column of a different type).  Also fixed some console output
    code (used in command-line mode) that ran afoul of some recently-added
    GCC warnings.

2010-02-20  JMB  Better dialog sizing, note button resize handling

    Dialogs now remember the last dimensions they were resized to, and use
    that size again when next launched (so you don't need to resize them
    again if you don't like the default size).  Also, the portion of a note
    shown in the edit button of the row editor dialog is now dynamically
    adjusted as the size of the dialog changes.

2009-12-21  JMB  Qt 4 port

    Since a non-Windows pocket computer capable of running Qt 4 applications
    finally came out (namely the Nokia Internet Tablets, once the Qt 4 port
    was completed in 2008-2009), I finally decided to drop Qt 2 support for
    PortaBase.  This allowed me to clean up all the quirky code imposed by the
    old Qt API and the Qtopia environment, converting it into a fairly clean
    modern C++ application...and I documented all the code with Doxygen while
    I was at it.
    
    This is a snapshot of the code as it stands at the point where it's
    becoming useful for other people to look at it again.  I've been developing
    it on the Mac, where so far everything seems to work except for encrypted
    file support.  Before the 2.0 release I'll fix that and make sure that
    it also works on Linux, Windows, Maemo, and possibly Symbian S60 and
    Windows Mobile.

2004-05-06  JMB  Mac OS X support

    Lots of little code tweaks to make PortaBase work properly and look
    reasonably native on Mac OS X.  Also added the files needed to generate
    an application bundle.  This is the code that was submitted to
    Trolltech's Qt/Mac application developer contest.

2004-03-29  #################### PortaBase 1.9 ####################

2004-03-29  JMB  Translation updates, minor row viewer fix, etc.

    Up-to-date versions of all translations, fixed the view selection
    list in the row viewer to use more of the available width, and probably
    some other things I don't remember.

2004-03-27  JMB  Start in last used directory on recent Sharp ROMs

    Based on a patch received from Usui Makoto, PortaBase for ROMs using
    the newer file selector now starts with the directory containing the
    last-viewed file shown.

2004-03-13  JMB  Minor condition editor bugfix

    Fixed the condition editor so that the previous value is correctly
    selected when editing existing enum conditions.

2004-03-05  JMB  Zaurus build fixes, translation file updates

    Fixed some places where compilation for the Zaurus broke during the
    process of desktop version development.  Also updated all the UI
    translation files with the current set of messages used so that they
    are ready for the translators to prepare for the version 1.9 release.

2004-02-27  JMB  Localization improvements

    Made several changes that let PortaBase work better for non-English
    languages.  First, it should now correctly open files with names that
    use characters beyond Latin-1 or files in directories whose names contain
    such characters (except in Windows 95, 98, and Me which I believe simply
    don't support this).

    Also patched Metakit to enable locale-sensitive sorting.  For example,
    when running on a Japanese system it sorts in "a-i-u-e-o" order with
    hiragana before katakana and kanji, and it should sort accented characters
    correctly when using a locale such as French or German.  Note that this
    does mean that the sorting order of string and note fields may change
    depending on the locale of the computer or PDA you run PortaBase on;
    that's probably what most people want, though.

    Finally, loading of translation and help files on the desktop versions
    was fixed so that full locale codes can be used instead of only 2-letter
    language codes; for example, a distinction can now be made between zh_CN
    and zh_TW.

2004-02-25  JMB  Assorted Windows fixes and code cleanup, file drag & drop

    Fixed JPEG image loading on Windows, better default dialog sizes on the
    desktop versions, removed "What's This" buttons from dialog title bars
    since there is no content associated with them, and other assorted code
    cleanup.

    Also added support for opening a PortaBase file in the desktop versions
    by dragging it onto the application window while there isn't another
    file open.

2004-01-31  JMB  Support for Qt 3.2.1 Non-Commercial Windows version

    Updated the code to transition from using Qt 2.3.0 to Qt 3.2.1 on Windows.
    Switched to use QSettings on all desktop versions in the process, which
    lets preferences be stored in more appropriate locations on Windows and
    Mac OS X.  This also allows proper language detection on Windows (so the
    batch-script-per-language hack is no longer necessary).  Also allows
    native look on Windows XP, and probably fixes a few other bugs in the
    Windows version.

2004-01-30  JMB  Slideshows

    There is now a Slideshow item in the File menu; this lets you do a timed
    slideshow over the images in one Image column of the current view.  Only
    rows in the current filter are included, and they are shown in the order
    of the current sorting.

2004-01-27  JMB  More robust MIME type registration

    Changed the postinst script used during Zaurus installation to check
    for a missing newline at the end of the mime.types file before adding
    entries for "application/portabase" and "text/x-csv".  Fixes cases where
    the last installed program that added a new MIME type didn't end the
    file correctly.

2004-01-25  JMB  Translate date strings, fixed note button width, Row->Show

    Fixed the date display in the row editor, etc. to properly translate the
    day and month names.

    Reduced the amount of text shown on the button for note fields in the row
    editor; as it was, the button was often too wide and caused a horizontal
    scrollbar to be shown.

    Added a Row->Show menu item which launches the row viewer for the
    currently selected row.

2003-10-07  JMB  Enum editor bugfix

    Until now, deleting two options in the enum editor before clicking "OK"
    had a good chance of crashing PortaBase; fixed it to work properly.

2003-10-06  JMB  Image columns

    There is now an "Image" column type; each entry in such a column is
    either empty or contains a copy of a JPEG or PNG image.  These images
    can be seen in the row viewer, by clicking on a "View" button in the
    row editor, and via a click-and-hold on an icon in the data viewer.

2003-09-15  JMB  Date picker enhancements

    Changed the date picker so it is sized according to the size of the
    current font (especially important on the C7x0 models, where the fixed
    size was really too small).

    Also changed it to highlight the current date, and added a "Today"
    button to automatically jump to that date.

2003-09-12  JMB  Default rows per page preference, file properties dialog

    There is now a spinbox in the preferences dialog which lets you set the
    default number of rows per page to use for new views.

    There is also a new file properties dialog which gives basic statistics
    about the current file (name, file size, number of rows, etc.)

2003-09-11  JMB  CSV import enhancement, save/restore window geometry

    During CSV import, a blank in an integer or decimal column now gets
    replaced with the default value for that column.  Some other database
    programs seem to allow blanks in number fields, so this should help
    import data from those.

    The desktop versions now save the location and size of the main window
    when PortaBase is closed and restore them when it is launched again.

2003-09-10  JMB  Menu shortcuts and accelerators in desktop versions

    Added accelerators (underlined letters which activate the item when that
    key is pressed on the keyboard) and shortcuts (like "Ctrl-N") for
    menu items where appropriate in the desktop versions.  The Zaurus
    versions work as before, since the underlining and shortcut labels
    take up space and it is unusual to work primarily from the keyboard on a
    PDA (even on the C7x0 models).

2003-09-09  JMB  View selector in row viewer, desktop recent files menu

    The row viewer now has a droplist from which any of the defined views
    can be chosen; the selection of displayed fields is then updated to match
    that view.

    The "recently opened files" list which is tracked starting in version 1.8
    for the benefit of the file browser on the new sharp ROMs is now also
    available as an "Open Recent" submenu under the "File" menu in the
    desktop versions of PortaBase.

2003-09-08  JMB  Text copy from row viewer, time difference calculations

    There is now a copy button in the row viewer which allows you to copy
    the selected text (if any) to the clipboard.

    Also added three new operators for calculated fields: "Seconds_Between",
    "Minutes_Between", and "Hours_Between".  Each returns the difference
    between two time columns, measured using the appropriate unit.  Fixed
    some minor bugs in the calculation editor in the process (the equation
    display and button status sometimes weren't updated correctly).

2003-09-05  JMB  Toolbar button preferences

    Similar to the menu preferences, there is a new tab in the preferences
    dialog which allows selection and ordering of the buttons to be shown
    in the toolbar.  Current options are Save, Add, Edit, Copy, Delete, and
    Quick Filter.

2003-09-04  JMB  Menu layout preferences

    You can now choose which among the Row, View, Sort, and Filter menus
    you want to appear as top-level menus and which you want to put as
    submenus under the File menu instead.  You can also choose the order
    in which to arrange these menus.  There is a new tab in the preferences
    dialog for configuring this.

2003-09-03  JMB  Added non-paged display option

    Added a new checkbox in the preferences dialog which allows you to turn
    off paging in the data viewer, so all rows in the current filter are
    displayed on one page and the row of navigation buttons is hidden.

2003-09-02  JMB  Windows titlebars fix, code cleanup

    Added " - Qt" to the end of all window titles in the Windows version so
    they will be displayed properly in the non-commercial version of Qt
    (so the "title labels" at the top of each window in previous versions
    added to work around this problem have been removed).

    Also reorganized some of the code to make it smaller and easier to
    maintain; this also eliminates some duplication in the translation files.

2003-08-31  #################### PortaBase 1.8 ####################

2003-08-21  JMB  Fixed Zaurus encryption bug

    I think I finally found the cause of the crash on opening some encrypted
    files on the Zaurus and fixed it.

2003-08-20  JMB  Better save icon for SL-C7x0 series

    Added a larger version of the save icon for use on the 640x480 display
    of the Zaurus SL-C7x0 models.

2003-08-19  JMB  French UI update, file creation bugfix, Japanese help fix

    Incorporated the latest UI updates from Eric Santonacci, and fixed a
    bug in creating new files that showed up on my SL-C760 but not in the
    test environment (glad I got that before releasing...)  Also discovered
    that the Japanese help file often (always?) got overwritten by the
    English one due to linking differences between the US and Japan Zaurus
    models...fixed so the correct help file always gets shown.

2003-08-11  JMB  Czech UI translation, Japanese translation updates

    Added a Czech translation of the user interface (provided by Jaromir
    Mara), integrated the latest Japanese help updates provided by
    Tsukamoto-san, and made a few tweaks to the Japanese UI translation.

2003-08-10  JMB  Columns editor bugfixes, MIN/MAX bugfix

    Calculation fields weren't being properly updated when columns that
    they referenced were renamed or deleted; fixed this.  Also fixed
    a bug in MIN and MAX calculations.

2003-08-03  JMB  New Zaurus file navigation bugfixes

    Fixed a few bugs with support for the file navigation widget on newer
    ROMs (now that I got around to actually testing it on a 3.10-installed
    SL-5500).

2003-07-30  JMB  Windows file association, build fixes

    Set the installer to associate ".pob" files with PortaBase, so they
    appear with the PortaBase icon and launch correctly when double-clicked.
    You always get the English version when doing this; to get another
    language by default, set the "LANG" environment variable to the correct
    language code (this is a workaround for a bug in old Windows versions of
    Qt; the language-specific menu items just run a batch script which does
    this for you.)  Also fixed a few bugs in Windows-specific code that crept
    in since 1.7.

2003-07-25  JMB  French UI translation, other translation updates

    Added a translation of the user interface into French, contributed by
    Eric Santonacci.  Also updated the Japanese UI translation and did
    some cleanup work on the Taiwanese UI translation file.

2003-07-24  JMB  Sequence columns, row viewer obeys current view

    There is now a "Sequence" column type; this is an integer field which
    starts at a specified number and assigns each new row a value one greater
    than the last.  Useful for automatically assigning row identification
    numbers, among other things.

    The row viewer now only shows the fields included in the current view,
    which can be useful when dealing with databases containing many fields.
    To see all fields in the row viewer as before, just select the "All
    Columns" view before launching it.

2003-07-23  JMB  Support for new Zaurus file navigation widget

    PortaBase can now be built with support for Sharp's new file navigation
    widget (available in the SL-5600, SL-5500 with the 3.10 ROM, and all
    Japanese Linux-based Zaurus models).  This allows directory navigation
    and creating files on the CF or SD cards without first saving them in
    main memory, among other advantages.  Since the library containing this
    widget is not available for older ROMs or OpenZaurus, the old Qtopia
    file list widget is still supported as an option.

2003-06-19  JMB  Calculated fields, view rename bugfix

    There is now a new column type called "Calculation", which represents
    a value derived from the values of other columns in the same row.  The
    formula for this calculation is defined by the user in a dialog launched
    by clicking a button in the column editor.

    Version 1.6 introduced a bug where attempting to rename a view would
    crash PortaBase; just fixed this.

2003-06-11  #################### PortaBase 1.7 ####################

2003-06-04  JMB  Columns editor bugfix

    Fixed bug in columns editor where editing a column after adding one
    of another type could result in incorrect data being displayed.

2003-06-03  JMB  Taiwanese translation, updated Japanese UI translation

    Added a Taiwanese translation of the UI and help file provided by
    Jeng-Ping Lin.  Also updated the Japanese UI translation to include
    phrases from the color selector dialog and such.

2003-06-02  JMB  Dynamic string entry field bugfixes

    Fixed a few usability problems with the new dynamic string entry
    fields.  A horizontal scrollbar is never shown (it completely obscured
    the text), it no longer defines a minimum width large enough to force
    a horizontal scrollbar in the row editor, and tab and shift+tab can
    once again be used to navigate between fields instead of adding a
    tab to the displayed text.  (If you really want to add a tab, you
    can copy and paste one from elsewhere.)

2003-05-29  JMB  Dynamic multi-line string entry fields, CR-only CSV import

    Text boxes for string fields in the row editor now accept multiple
    lines of input; pressing return causes the height of the input field
    to grow by one row.  This is basically the way that text entry fields
    work in many PalmOS and Psion applications, except that word wrap isn't
    enabled (Qt doesn't estimate the width of text lines accurately enough
    to reliably calculate the number of lines needed).

    PortaBase now correctly imports CSV files which use only carriage
    returns for line endings.  This is the format used by old MacOS versions
    and at least some Psion data export utilities, maybe by other software
    as well.

2003-05-28  JMB  Enum option sorting, import, and export

    Added a button to the enum editor which sorts the enum's options in
    alphabetical order.  Clicking once sorts in ascending order, clicking
    again sorts in descending order.  Helps keep enums with many options
    organized (such as a list of people's names).

    The enum editor also has new import and export buttons.  Export creates
    a text file with each option on a separate line.  Import opens such a
    file and adds to the enum any lines from it which aren't already listed
    as options.

2003-05-24  JMB  Better menu handling in desktop versions

    In at least some versions of Qt3, the menu was present but no text was
    shown.  Now using a more normal display method which seems to work more
    reliably.

2003-05-23  JMB  Alternate row shading, calculator widget

    Even and odd rows now use different background colors to make it easier
    to follow a row across the screen.  The default colors are white and
    light gray, but can be specified via buttons in the Preferences dialog.
    These colors are used in the data viewer, columns editor, view editor,
    and sorting editor.

    At the end of each entry field for a numeric value (type integer or
    decimal), there is a button which will launch a simple calculator,
    starting with the currently displayed value.  Clicking OK will place
    the current result into the entry field.  This makes it easier to enter
    data that needs to be calculated before entry, and is often faster than
    entering a number via the keyboard or an on-screen input method.

2003-04-10  JMB  Windows CSV import bugfix

    In version 1.6, importing a CSV file on the Windows version would produce
    an empty error dialog and fail to update the display even though the
    import was successful; this has been corrected.

2003-04-03  JMB  Enum update bugfix, file overwrite warning

    When the value of an enum was changed, its index wasn't updated in the
    data table, so it was sorted and filtered as if its value hadn't changed;
    this has been corrected.

    The desktop versions now launch a confirmation dialog if you choose an
    existing file when selecting the path to a new PortaBase file.  Useful
    if you accidentally click "New" instead of "Open" and don't realize it.

2003-04-02  JMB  XML export bugfix, desktop import bugfix

    Version 1.6 accidentally exported an element called "gcrypt" indicating
    whether the source file was encrypted or not; this is no longer exported,
    and the XML import will gracefully ignore it if present.

    The desktop version of 1.6 prompted for a text encoding even when
    importing XML files and MobileDB files; this wasn't necessary and is
    no longer done.

2003-03-30  #################### PortaBase 1.6 ####################

2003-03-30  JMB  CSV import enhancements, menu update bugfix

    If an imported row doesn't have enough columns and the last few
    columns are strings or notes, PortaBase now treats those fields as
    empty strings.  (There often aren't enough delimiters at the end of
    lines ending with blank fields when exporting from programs like Excel,
    this just corrects for that.)

    CSV files can now be imported as either UTF-8 or Latin-1; this avoids
    the need for users importing files exported from other programs in
    Latin-1 to use another program to perform an encoding conversion.

    In version 1.5, making changes in the format editor would clear the
    view, sorting, and filter lists from the menus without restoring them;
    they are now populated correctly again.

2003-03-27  JMB  Japanese UI translation, better CSV import error messages

    The entire PortaBase interface has now been translated into Japanese.
    I also improved the error messages provided upon CSV import failure;
    cases where it used to just say "Wrong number of columns" now specify
    which columns are missing or which values are extra, and it shows the
    full data row which failed to import correctly.

2003-03-19  JMB  Data file encryption

    PortaBase data files can now be encrypted (using Blowfish in CBC mode
    with a 160-bit key generated by running the password through SHA-1).
    More details will be posted on the web site when 1.6 is released.
    Encryption is an option chosen when the file is created; to encrypt
    an existing file, export it to XML and import the result as a new
    encrypted file.

2003-03-01  JMB  Command-line CSV import and export

    You can now import and export CSV files from the command line by using
    the "fromcsv" and "tocsv" commands; usage is basically identical to
    "fromxml" and "toxml", except that for "fromcsv" the target file must
    be an existing PortaBase file.

2003-02-28  JMB  Default sortings and filters for views

    You can now specify a default sorting and/or filter for each view
    (except the "All Columns" view, which cannot be edited).  This makes
    it faster to switch to commonly used view/sorting/filter combinations.
    If the defaults are not "None", they are applied when switching to
    the view; you can then freely change the sorting and filter again.
    If "None", the current sorting and filter are retained, as it has always
    worked.

2003-02-27  JMB  Enum option index sorting/filtering, enum manager bugfix

    Changed enum sorting to sort by option index instead of option text.
    Enum filter conditions changed to match, allowing the full set of
    numeric inequality operators.

    Fixed a bug in the enum manager which caused a crash if you exited
    without making any changes (bug introduced in 1.5).

2003-02-26  JMB  File rename and copy menu items

    The file selector's "File" menu now has "Rename" and "Copy" items
    which do what you'd expect.  (Zaurus version only)

2003-02-25  JMB  File->Row menu, row copy

    Added a "Row" submenu to the data viewer's "File" menu to replace the
    old top-level menu of the same name that was removed due to lack of
    space.

    Added a "Copy" action to the new Row menu, which launches the row
    editor to create a new row, but filled with the currently selected
    row's data instead of the default values.

2003-02-24  JMB  Fixed XML import bug, command-line error message encoding

    The XML importer was retrieving column values by index instead of
    ID, leading to import failure in many cases; fixed.

    Error messages shown during command-line usage should now be using
    a reasonable encoding for the locale; hopefully this will allow the
    display of Japanese text on the Japanese Zaurus models.

2003-02-19  JMB  Better XML import error messages

    Don't overwrite meaningful error message with useless generic error
    message.  Fixes behavior on Zaurus and Windows.

2003-02-12  #################### PortaBase 1.5 ####################

2003-02-12  JMB  Assorted bug fixes and code cleanup

    In the process of testing the code for a 1.5 release, fixed an
    assortment of minor usability bugs, compiler warnings, and so on.

2003-02-10  JMB  Import file selector crash fix

    Fixed a crash when clicking "OK" in the import file selector instead
    of clicking on one of the listed files.  (Zaurus version only)

2003-02-09  JMB  XML import, command-line format conversions,
                 minor enum manager enhancement

    New PortaBase files can now be created from PortaBase-format XML files
    as well as MobileDB files; the file selector's File->Import option
    now covers both cases.  This means that PortaBase content can now
    be exported to XML, edited by hand or by script, and imported back in
    as a new file.  Or files can be programatically generated, including
    views, filters, etc.

    PortaBase can now be used from the command line to create PortaBase
    files from XML or MobileDB files, and to export PortaBase files to XML
    (optionally specifying the view, sorting, and/or filter to apply first).
    This should make it fairly easy to write scripts that create or
    manipulate PortaBase data files.  Check the help file or run
    "portabase -h" for details on the syntax.

    The enum manager now doesn't mark the file as needing to be saved unless
    a change was actually performed.

2003-02-06  JMB  Assorted minor enhancements

    Added size grips for dialogs on the Windows version.

    Compensated for the lack of dialog titles in the Non-Commercial
    version of Qt for Windows; each dialog on that platform now has the
    dialog name in bold text just below the title bar.

    The text area of the note editor now has the focus when the dialog
    is shown (don't need to click or tab before starting to type).

    The name entry field of the column editor now has the focus each time
    it is shown.

2003-02-03  JMB  XML export

    When you choose "Export" from the File menu, you now have the option
    of exporting to XML.  The exported XML file contains all the
    information needed to completely recreate the data file as the user
    experiences it (including views, filters, etc.)  It can also be used
    to generate HTML via XSLT files, or manipulated in any other way
    XML is normally handled.  A few examples and more info will be posted
    on the web site along with the version 1.5 release.

2003-01-30  JMB  Allow word wrap in Note editor/viewer, added Preferences
                 and Refresh options to file selector menu, edit button in
                 row viewer

    The Note editor/viewer now uses word wrapping by default; this can
    be disabled in the preferences dialog.  There is also a preference
    setting which allows wrapping to be done even between non-whitespace
    characters (useful for languages like Japanese).

    The Preferences dialog can now be launched from the file selector's
    "File" menu, so you don't need to open a file before changing your
    application settings.

    Added an edit button to the row viewer, so you can edit the currently
    visible row without first returning to the data viewer.

    Added a "Refresh" option to the file selector menu to check for
    recently added or deleted files.  This wasn't being done when
    re-launching the program if "Fast load" was enabled.  Also, this is no
    longer done automatically after closing a non-new file, because it can
    be slow (especially when using a CF and/or SD card).  Zaurus version
    only.

2003-01-28  JMB  Support use as a Linux or Windows desktop application

    Made a wide variety of minor code changes that allow PortaBase to
    be compiled for use as a Linux or Windows desktop application; I've
    checked in the files needed to build a Debian package and a Windows
    installer.  So PortaBase 1.5 will be released for the Zaurus,
    Debian GNU/Linux, and Windows; data files created with any of these
    versions can be opened with any of the others (and the desktop
    versions store column widths and rows per page settings independent of
    those used on the Zaurus, due to radically different screen sizes).
    This should make it much easier to keep data synchronized between the
    Zaurus and PCs, or PortaBase can be used as a standalone desktop
    application.

2003-01-26  JMB  Time column "Now" default bugfix, Qt NC license clause

    Time columns which were set to "now" were using a default value of
    midnight instead; should now work correctly.

    Added an exception to the license to allow use of the Non-Commercial
    version of Qt for Windows (not allowed using the unmodified GPL).

2003-01-13  ################### PortaBase 1.4.1 ###################

2003-01-13  JMB  Fixed upgrade of files that use filters

    Converting any PortaBase file that used filters to a newer version
    has often created corrupt files due to a bug in the filter conditions
    table.  1.4 contained an attempted fix which didn't fully correct the
    problem, this should (although already corrupted files still cannot
    be opened.)

2003-01-07  #################### PortaBase 1.4 ####################

2003-01-07  JMB  Increased maximum rows per page, space launches row viewer

    You can now show up to 9999 rows in a page instead of 999.  Whether
    there's enough memory on the Zaurus to handle that many rows gracefully is
    another question. ^_^

    Just noticed that the center of the direction pad is treated as a
    space bar instead of an enter key, so that now also works to launch the
    row viewer.

2003-01-05  JMB  Row viewer/browser

    Added a row viewer based on a patch I received.  To launch it, either
    double-tap on a row or press enter while the desired row is selcted.
    Includes next and previous buttons to navigate between rows in the
    current view (left and right on the direction pad also work).

2003-01-04  JMB  File selector menu & toolbar, MobileDB import, better
                 sizing of column and condition editor dialogs, file extension
                 added for new files

    The file selector now has a "File" menu and 3 toolbar buttons; in
    addition to the previous functionality, these let you delete existing
    files.  The File menu also contains an option to create a new file
    from the data in a MobileDB file; MobileDB is a popular database
    program for PalmOS, many reference database files and such can be
    downloaded for it at no cost.

    Applied a patch to improve sizing of the column editor and condition
    editor dialogs; the hard-coded values didn't work well on the SL-C700.

    Another patch for the SL-C700; new files now have the ".pob" extension
    added so they show up correctly in the "Files" tab.

2002-12-07  JMB  Time columns, date picker uses appropriate week start day

    There is now a "Time" column type.  It uses the Qtopia system setting
    for 12/24 hour display preference, and there is a "Show Seconds"
    checkbox in the PortaBase preferences dialog.  Times in imported CSV
    files can be formatted in either 12 or 24 hour format, or in number
    of seconds past midnight, or -1 or blank for a "None" time.

    The date picker calendar widget now uses the Qtopia system setting
    for which day the week starts on (Sunday or Monday) and displays the
    calendar appropriately.

2002-12-01  JMB  Bugfix in filter condition indices, filtered export

    The data column for filter condition position indices had been declared
    incorrectly, causing problems when loading filters from older format
    PortaBase files; this should be fixed now (although the original
    condition order is often not recoverable; a new valid order is defined).

    The CSV export feature now exports only rows which pass the current
    filter.  For the old "export all" behavior, just select the "All Rows"
    filter before exporting.

2002-11-30  JMB  Case sensitivity bugfix

    Applied a patch to MetaKit that allows c4_View Finds and Selects to be
    case sensitive (which I thought they already were).  This fixes
    several bugs related to columns, views, sortings, and filters which
    have names differing only by case.

2002-11-29  JMB  Optional checkbox toggle in data viewer, date selector
                 enhancements

    Added a preference which when checked allows you to toggle boolean
    values directly in the data viewer by clicking the appropriate cell.
    This makes it more convenient to use PortaBase as a todo list, but
    also makes it easier to accidentally change data values.

    Changed the date selector dialog so that the month is displayed as
    a droplist and the year is displayed as a spinbox; thus both can
    be changed directly to any desired value without having to
    repeatedly press the next or previous buttons.

2002-11-26  JMB  UTF-8 CSV file import

    Fixed a one-line bug which caused CSV files to be imported as Latin-1
    instead of UTF-8.

2002-11-25  #################### PortaBase 1.3 ####################

2002-11-24  JMB  Enum columns

    Added support for enum columns (otherwise known as enumerations,
    pop-ups, string lists, etc.)  There is a new "Edit Enums" item in the
    "File" menu, and as a shortcut enums can be defined when creating a
    new column by selecting "(New Enum)" as the type.

2002-11-19  JMB  Better precision on decimal fields, "default defaults"

    In previous releases, decimal fields were only shown with six
    significant digits.  Now the entered string representation is stored
    along with the floating point number obtained from it, so when browsing
    the data or editing rows, these values are displayed exactly as they
    were entered.

    When adding a new column and you pick either Integer or Decimal as the
    type, the current content (if any) of the default value entry box is
    examined; if not valid for the new type it is replaced with 0 (for
    integers) or 0.0 (for decimals).  This way you aren't forced to enter
    a default value if you don't care what it is.

2002-11-17  JMB  Font selection, empty date fields, delete confirmations,
                 delete rows in filter

    There is now a preferences dialog (available under File->Preferences)
    which allows you to choose the font used throughout PortaBase.  This
    can be used, for example, to select a font capable of displaying
    Japanese characters or to choose a smaller font size in order to fit
    more information on the screen (although a bit less legibly).

    Date fields can now be displayed as empty; either choose "None" as
    the default value in the column editor or click the "None" button
    next to the date in the row editor.  Empty dates are treated
    internally as September 14, 1752 (the first day of the Gregorian
    calendar), and behave accordingly in sorting, filtering, and column
    statistics dialogs.

    There is now an option to show delete confirmation dialogs whenever
    you delete a row, view, sorting, or filter.  To enable these, check
    "Delete Confirmations" under File->Preferences.

    There is a new "Delete Rows In Filter" option in the "File" menu,
    which deletes all rows that pass the current filter.  Thus you can
    select the "All Rows" filter and purge the database in preparation
    for a new CSV import, or use a filter to delete all rows where
    a date field is earlier than a certain value, and so on.

2002-11-16  JMB  Unicode support

    The encoding for all text in PortaBase files has been changed from
    Latin-1 to UTF-8; old files are automatically converted to the new
    encoding when opened.  Unicode characters can now be used in row
    data, column names, view names, filter names, etc.

2002-11-12  JMB  Better handling of import failure

    A failed CSV import now leaves the database in the same condition
    it was in before the attempt.  Before, it was adding rows
    processed before the error and not immediately updating the
    display to show that this had happened.

2002-11-10  #################### PortaBase 1.2 ####################

2002-11-10  JMB  Date columns, crash fixes, toolbar changes

    Added support for date columns; values are entered using a calendar
    widget.

    Fixed bugs in the data viewer, sorting editor, and view editor which
    could cause a crash if you clicked in the wrong place.

    Due to space considerations, made some changes to the menus and
    toolbar.  The "Find" menu was renamed "Filter", and the "Find"
    toolbar button was moved to the "Quick" option under the "Filter"
    menu.

2002-11-09  JMB  Filtering, "All Columns" sequence bugfix

    Added the "Find" menu, providing support for multiple-condition
    filters using an interface very similar to that of views and sortings.
    Removed the "Row" menu in order to make room for it.

    Also added the "Find" toolbar button, which is a faster way to create
    a 1-condition temporary filter.

    Fixed a bug introduced by the "All Columns" view updating feature that
    caused a crash when creating a new database.

2002-11-01  JMB  Improved Note field display, update "All Columns" sequence

    Note fields are now shown as intended in the data viewer; as many
    characters from the start of the note as will fit are shown, with
    linebreaks converted to spaces.  In 1.1 only one row of the note was
    being shown, and not necessarily the first one.

    The "All Columns" view now tracks changes to the sequence of columns so
    it matches the order in the columns editor and row editor.

2002-10-30  JMB  Dialog resizing, save enable/disable, hold on row to edit

    All full-screen dialogs should now resize correctly when input methods
    are hidden or shown.

    The save icon and menu item are now enabled only when there are unsaved
    changes.  (Including changes of view, sorting, rows per page, etc.)

    Pressing and holding on a row in the data viewer for 1/2 second or
    longer now launches the row editor (except if you press in a Note
    column; this still shows the Note viewer).

2002-10-28  #################### PortaBase 1.1 ####################

2002-10-28  JMB  Multiple column sorting

    Added support for sorting on multiple columns.

2002-10-26  JMB  Note column type, minor bugfixes

    Added support for "Note" columns (a.k.a. multi-line text fields).

    Count change of view to "All Columns" as a change that the user should
    be prompted to save before closing.

    Removed help file sentence about ".csv" being appended to export files;
    true in the test environment, but apparently not on the Zaurus.

2002-10-22  JMB  View editor crash bugfix

    Fixed a crash that occurred when saving changes to an existing view.

2002-10-21  JMB  Fixed CSV export

    The text/x-csv directory is now created if it doesn't exist, and a
    ".desktop" file is created so the CSV file appears in the Documents tab.
