Platform-Specific Installation Instructions
-------------------------------------------
For instructions on compiling PortaBase for your particular platform, see the
appropriate file under the "doc" directory:

* install_linux.txt
* install_mac.txt
* install_maemo.txt
* install_windows.txt

The notes below are relevant to generating the PortaBase help files and source
code documentation on all the supported platforms.

Help Pages Generation
---------------------
PortaBase's help pages are generated from a simple text-based markup using
Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/).  To create a full PortaBase installation
package, you'll need Python 2.4 or higher, Sphinx 1.1 or higher, and
sphinx_rtd_theme.  The scripts for building the installer on each platform
assume that these are present and automatically generate and include the help
pages.  If you also want to retrieve the latest version of a translation of
the help pages from the PortaBase Transifex project, you'll probably also want
to install transifex-client.  See the platform-specific install_*.txt files
for more information.

Code Documentation Generation
-----------------------------
The PortaBase source code has been documented in a manner that allows
browsable documentation to be generated in HTML and other formats using
Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html).  To do so:

- Install Doxygen on your system
- Download the version of Qt whose documentation you want to link to (optional)
- Make sure the TAGFILES line in PortaBase's "Doxyfile" file uses the correct
  paths for the qt*.tags file in the Qt documentation you downloaded and
  references the Qt documentation root you wish to link to; this can be either
  online or local (optional)
- Install Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/) and either make sure that the
  "dot" executable is in your path or set the "DOT_PATH" setting accordingly
  in Doxyfile and Doxyfile_Metakit.  Alternatively, you can set "HAVE_DOT" to
  "NO" in both of these files to disable diagram generation instead.
- From the Portabase source code main directory, run the appropriate doxygen
  script for your platform from the packaging directory (for example,
  packaging/mac/doxygen.sh).

There are a lot of optional features in Doxygen, so you may want to read
through its documentation and change some of the settings in Doxyfile and
Doxyfile_Metakit before generating the documentation.
