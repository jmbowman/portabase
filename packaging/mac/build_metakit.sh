# Script to configure Metakit as a static library.  Only targets 64-bit Intel
# processors, which is what Apple currently recommends and is what Xcode 4 is
# set up to accomplish.

# To produce a Leopard-compatible universal binary library instead, pass the
# string "universal" as a parameter.  You'll need to either be running a
# version of Xcode earlier than Xcode 4, or go through some interesting hoops
# to reinstate support for older compilers and target SDKs.
