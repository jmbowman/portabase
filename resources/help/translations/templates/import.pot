msgid "From the \"File\" menu in the :ref:`data viewer <data_viewer>`, select \"Import\".  A file dialog will open which allows you pick the CSV file you want to import from.  The CSV file must have the same number of columns as the open database file, and the values in those columns must be appropriate for the specified column types.  You may specify the encoding of the text file in order to import non-ASCII characters correctly; the default is UTF-8 (which supports text in many languages), but you may also choose Latin-1 (which is used by most software configured for use primarily with Western European languages)."
