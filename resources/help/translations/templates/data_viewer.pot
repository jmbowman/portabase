msgid "Most of the data viewer screen is occupied by a table showing one view of a set of rows in the database.  You can scroll through the entire list of rows passing the current filter; performance stays good because only the data for the rows currently shown in the display is loaded.  Clicking on a row normally launches the :ref:`row viewer <row_viewer>` dialog; if you disabled this in the :ref:`preferences dialog <preferences>`, you can stil launch it by pressing enter/return, space, or Control-R (Command-R on the Mac) while a row is selected."

When done on a cell in an Image column, the image contained in that cell is shown in the :ref:`image viewer <image_viewer>`.

The spin box at the bottom left specifies the maximum number of rows to display at once for the current view; you can edit this to be any positive integer (setting it low enough eliminates the scrollbar on the right of the display table, giving a little more horizontal space; note that Maemo Fremantle has no such scrollbar).  To the right of this \"rows per page\" box are the page navigation buttons.  Click on one of the numbered buttons to go to that page of rows; the button for the current page is shown pressed.  Click on the arrow buttons at the ends to show the page buttons for the next or previous five pages."

To change the widths of the columns in the current view, click on the border between two column labels (or the right edge of the last column) and drag it to the desired location.  Clicking on a column label sorts all the rows passing the current filter by the content of that column in ascending order; clicking it again sorts in descending order.  If you press a column label and hold it for 1/2 second or more before releasing, the :ref:`column statistics dialog <column_statistics>` is shown."
