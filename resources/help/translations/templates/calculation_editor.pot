It is launched by pressing the \"Edit calculation\" button in the column editor, which appears only for columns of type \"Calculation\".  At the top of the dialog are the name of the column, a read-only display of the current calculation written as a one-line expression, and a spin box that allows you to specify how many decimal places should be shown for the calculation results."
