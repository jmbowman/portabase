This can usually be guessed based on the operating system in use, but some netbooks and MIDs running PC operating systems might be better off with the small-screen settings."

That font will then be used for all text in PortaBase (even after exiting the application and restarting it) until you pick a different one.  You may use this if the default font doesn't support unicode characters (rare on modern systems) or to fit more text on the screen.  (This option isn't available on Mac OS X, which doesn't seem to like applications using non-standard fonts for the UI.)  On Maemo Fremantle, the rows will remain at a finger-friendly height regardless of font size unless the \"Adjust row height to match font\" option is checked."
