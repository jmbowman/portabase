msgid "PortaBase data files can be encrypted in order to protect sensitive information like passwords.  Each encrypted file is accessed by providing a password specified by the file's creator.  (This password can be changed later from the :ref:`File menu <file_menu>`'s \"Change Password\" action.)  Because this password must be relatively easy to remember, this is the weakest point in the encryption scheme; therefore, it is important to choose a good password.  Passwords should meet the following guidelines:"

msgid "For security and implementation reasons, the entire content of encrypted files must be held in memory at once; thus encrypted files cannot scale to large sizes as well as non-encrypted files.  Files of a few hundred or a few thousand rows should still perform well, but files containing many thousands of rows of data probably won't (at least on Maemo; desktop computers with lots of memory can handle quite large encrypted files)."
