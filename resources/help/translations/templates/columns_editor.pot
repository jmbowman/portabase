msgid "Each PortaBase file contains one table of a user-defined format.  The format of this table is determined by a sequence of data columns, each of which has its own name, data type, and default value. When creating a new PortaBase file, this dialog is shown so the data columns can be defined.  The columns of an existing file can also be edited at any time using this dialog by selecting the \"Edit Columns\" menu item (in the :ref:`data viewer <data_viewer>`, under the \"File\" menu except on Maemo where the menus are flattened)."

The default value is what will be entered for this column in any already existing data rows, and it will appear in the row editor when adding new rows as well."
