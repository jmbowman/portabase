msgid "The row viewer is a dialog designed to conveniently see all of the data for one row at a time.  Like the row editor, it has the column labels on the left and values on the right.  But the values are not editable, and they wrap so you don't have to scroll horizontally to see everything.  The complete content of note fields is shown as well, instead of just the first few words.  By default, only the columns in the current view are shown (in the view-specified order); to see a different set of columns, select the appropriate view from the droplist at the bottom of the dialog.  Pressing the left and right arrows at the bottom of the screen or the left and right arrow keys allows you to navigate between rows in the current view.  There are a few other buttons buttons at the bottom of the dialog:"
