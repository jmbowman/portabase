"PortaBase data files can be encrypted in order to protect sensitive "
"information like passwords.  Each encrypted file is accessed by providing a "
"password specified by the file's creator.  (This password can be changed "
"later from the :ref:`File menu <file_menu>`'s \"Change Password\" action.)  "
"Because this password must be relatively easy to remember, this is the "
"weakest point in the encryption scheme; therefore, it is important to choose"
" a good password.  Passwords should meet the following guidelines:"
msgstr "PortaBase資料檔可以使用加密來保護諸如密碼之類的機密資料。存取加密檔時需提供檔案主人指定的密碼。(此密碼稍後可由\\ :ref:`檔案 <file_menu>`\\ 選單的\"更改密碼\"來變更。) 因為密碼最好是好記，這也是加密架構中最脆弱的地方; 因此，選擇一個好密碼相當重要。密碼應符合下列原則："

"For security and implementation reasons, the entire content of encrypted "
"files must be held in memory at once; thus encrypted files cannot scale to "
"large sizes as well as non-encrypted files.  Files of a few hundred or a few"
" thousand rows should still perform well, but files containing many "
"thousands of rows of data probably won't (at least on Maemo; desktop "
"computers with lots of memory can handle quite large encrypted files)."
msgstr "由於安全性與實作上的緣故，加密檔案的整個內容必需存放在記憶體中; 因此加密檔案的大小可能會受到限制，無法跟無加密檔案一樣大。幾百或幾千列應當不成問題，再多一些可能就不行了(至少在Maemo上是如此; 擁有許多記憶體的桌上型電腦應當可以處理相當大的加密檔案)。"
