"The column statistics dialog, launched from the file properties dialog or by"
" long-pressing a column header, shows summary statistics about the data in a"
" column.  Only data in rows that pass the current filter is included in the "
"calculations.  If it was launched from the file properties dialog, a "
"droplist at the top of the dialog allows you to select which column to view "
"statistics for; only columns in the current view are listed.  At the bottom "
"of the dialog is a widget which allows you to edit the display width (in "
"pixels) of that column in the current view.  If you close the dialog by "
"clicking \"OK\"/\"Done\", any changes you made to the column widths will be "
"applied."

"欄位統計對話，可經由檔案性能對話或者按列標題久一點發動，就可以顯示欄位統計數字的總結。只有當前過濾後的列表上的數據才能包含在計算裡。如果由檔案性能對話來發動，則有一個下拉列表在對話器上方讓你可以選擇那些橍位你想看統計；也只有當前在灠示器裡的欄位才列出來。在對話裡的下端有一個物件可允許休修改欄位顯示的寬度(用pixels)。如果你以點擊\"Ok\"/\"Done\""
" 來關閉對話，則任何修改都會被應用到。"
