"The \"Note\" column type is for blocks of text which may contain multiple "
"lines (as opposed to the \"String\" type, which is better suited for "
"relatively short single lines of text).  The larger size of the content of "
"such columns merits its own (very simple) dialog.  Both in the :ref:`row "
"editor <row_editor>` and in the default value section of the column editor, "
"a Note value is shown as a button containing a note icon and the beginning "
"of the Note's content (as much as will fit).  To see and/or change the full "
"text, press this button; a full-screen text editor dialog will appear, "
"showing the current text of the Note.  Click \"OK\"/\"Done\" to accept any "
"changes you have made, or cancel out of the dialog to revert to the original"
" content."

"Note columns are treated a little specially in the :ref:`data viewer "
"<data_viewer>` also. The column label for Note columns contains a note icon "
"indicating that it is not just a String column.  The cells in the column "
"each show as much of the Note content as will fit.  If you press on one of "
"these cells and hold for 1/2 second or longer before releasing, a read-only "
"version of the Note editor is shown.  Either click \"OK\"/\"Done\" or cancel"
" out of the dialog to return to the data viewer."
