"Clicking on a column label in the data viewer is a convenient way to sort "
"the database contents by a single column.  But sometimes you may want to "
"sort by a combination of columns; sort by the content of column A, within "
"groups of the same value of A sort by the content of column B, etc.  To do "
"this or to sort by a column that isn't shown in the current view, you need "
"to define a named sorting."

"Sortings are defined using the sorting editor dialog, which is very similar "
"to the :ref:`view editor <view_editor>` dialog.  At the top of the dialog is"
" a text box containing the name of the sorting; changing this renames the "
"sorting.  Below that is a table showing the names of all the columns in the "
"database, with a checkbox next to each indicating whether or not it is to be"
" sorted.  Click this checkbox to add or remove the column from the set of "
"ones to be sorted.  The third column in the table shows either \"Ascending\""
" or \"Descending\" for checked rows, indicating which direction to sort in; "
"click this indicator to change it to the opposite value.  The dialog has "
"\"Up\" and \"Down\" buttons for moving the selected row up or down in the "
"table, changing the sequence in which the columns are sorted.  The rows are "
"sorted by the topmost checked column first, rows with the same value in that"
" column are sorted by the next highest checked column, etc.  Click "
"\"OK\"/\"Done\" to accept the currently shown settings or cancel out of the "
"dialog to revert to the previous values (or to cancel adding a new sorting)."
