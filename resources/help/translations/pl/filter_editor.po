"This dialog allows you to define filters which are used to select which rows"
" to display in the data viewer.  A filter may be as simple as \"count = 1\" "
"or something more complicated like \"any text column contains 'java', "
"chapters > 10, pages <= 400, and instock is checked\".  When you choose a "
"filter from the \"Filter\" menu, the data viewer is updated to show only the"
" rows which match the conditions you have defined."

"At the top of the dialog is a text box containing the name of the filter; "
"changing this renames the filter.  Below that is a list of the conditions "
"which make up the filter; a row must satisfy all of these conditions in "
"order to pass the filter.  \"Add\", \"Edit\", \"Delete\", \"Up\", and "
"\"Down\" buttons let you edit the condition list in basically the same way "
"as the :ref:`columns editor <columns_editor>` works.  But instead of the "
"column editor dialog, a condition editor dialog is launched by the \"Add\" "
"and \"Edit\" buttons.  This dialog lets you choose the column whose value to"
" compare, the comparison operation to use, and the constant value to compare"
" against.  For text comparisons, there is also a checkbox that lets you "
"indicate whether the comparison should be case sensitive or not.  Instead of"
" a single column, you can choose to compare the value of \"Any text "
"column\"; if the value of any String or Note column in a row satisfies such "
"a condition, the row is considered to pass the condition.  Click "
"\"OK\"/\"Done\" to accept the currently shown settings, or cancel out of the"
" dialog to revert to the previous values (or to cancel adding a new filter)."
