"PortaBase data files can be encrypted in order to protect sensitive "
"information like passwords.  Each encrypted file is accessed by providing a "
"password specified by the file's creator.  (This password can be changed "
"later from the :ref:`File menu <file_menu>`'s \"Change Password\" action.)  "
"Because this password must be relatively easy to remember, this is the "
"weakest point in the encryption scheme; therefore, it is important to choose"
" a good password.  Passwords should meet the following guidelines:"

"For security and implementation reasons, the entire content of encrypted "
"files must be held in memory at once; thus encrypted files cannot scale to "
"large sizes as well as non-encrypted files.  Files of a few hundred or a few"
" thousand rows should still perform well, but files containing many "
"thousands of rows of data probably won't (at least on Maemo; desktop "
"computers with lots of memory can handle quite large encrypted files)."
