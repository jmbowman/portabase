Image editor
============

An Image column stores pictures imported from JPEG or PNG image files.  After you select an image file to import into a field in the database, this dialog is shown so you can make minor changes to the copy of the image that will be saved in the database.  The top row contains the following controls:

**Width**
  The maximum allowed width of the image (in pixels).

**Height**
  The maximum allowed height of the image (in pixels).

**Rotate**
  The angle by which to rotate the image (in degrees): 0, 90, 180, or 270.

**Refresh**
  Apply the currently displayed settings and update the image preview accordingly.

Click "OK"/"Done" to store the image as it is shown, or cancel out of the dialog to leave the field unchanged.
