Mac OS X Development Environment
--------------------------------
To compile PortaBase for use as a Mac OS X desktop application, you will
need the following:
- Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) or higher
- Xcode (be sure to also install the command line utilities)
- A recent version of Qt (https://www.qt.io/download/); 5.5 or higher is
  recommended.

Metakit Compilation
-------------------
To compile PortaBase, Metakit (http://www.equi4.com/metakit/) must be compiled
first.  PortaBase uses a version of 2.4.9.8 patched to allow case-sensitive
searches and locale-sensitive sorting; the patched version is included in the
"metakit" directory for convenience (and to support the Debian and Maemo
autobuilders).

To compile Metakit for Mac OS X, from the root PortaBase source directory run
"packaging/mac/build_metakit.sh"; it'll prompt you for your password near the
end in order to install the files under /usr/local where they will be found
later when compiling PortaBase.

Help Pages Generation
---------------------
If you don't already have the "pip" installer for Python packages installed,
do so by running "sudo easy_install pip".  Then install Sphinx by running
"sudo pip install Sphinx" and install the theme used by the PortaBase
documentation by running "sudo pip install sphinx_rtd_theme".  You'll also
need GNU gettext to process the help file translations; you can download a
binary version from http://www.ellert.se/twain-sane/ or install it using
MacPorts.

To be able to automatically download the latest help page translations from
Transifex, also run "sudo pip install transifex-client".  Use the script at
packaging/generate_help.sh to generate the help files; see the top of the
script for usage information.

PortaBase compilation
---------------------
- Install a recent version of Qt as described above.
- Make sure the Metakit static library (libmk4.a) is in /usr/local/lib, and
  that the other library files (.dylib, .la, etc.) aren't.
- From the root PortaBase source directory run "packaging/mac/build.sh"; this
  will generate a self-contained PortaBase.app and a PortaBase.dmg installer.
  You'll need the libraries for help file generation installed as described
  above.
