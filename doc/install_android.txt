Android Development Environment
-------------------------------
To set up a development environment capable of building an Android package for
PortaBase, first install Qt 5.15.0 or above, including Qt Creator.  Then
follow the instructions at https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-developing-android.html
to have Qt Creator do most of the work in setting up an Android development
environment for you (this is much more tedious if you try to do it manually).

Metakit Compilation
-------------------
To configure and compile Metakit for Android, first set the value of the
NDK_HOME environment to the path of the NDK installation found in the Qt
Creator settings.  Then run the following command:

packaging/android/build_metakit.sh

By default this compiles a static library for armv7a; for a different
processor architecture, change the TARGET variable as described in the
script.

Help Pages Generation
---------------------
Follow the instructions in install_linux.txt or install_mac.txt, depending
on which operating system you're using to compile for Android.

PortaBase Compilation
---------------------
Open portabase.pro in Qt Creator.  Select a release build for Android as the
build target, then click the "Build" button.  You should end up with an
APK file that you can copy to an android device and install (if your device
has been configured to allow installation of packages from file).
