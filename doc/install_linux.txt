Debian Package Building
-----------------------
To create a Debian package for the desktop version of PortaBase, first install
the packages listed in the Build-Depends field of the "debian/control" file.
Then from the root PortaBase source directory run "packaging/linux/debian.sh".
The .deb file will be generated in the build/debian directory.  This build
process should also work on Debian-derived distributions like Ubuntu.

Linux/UNIX Development Environment
----------------------------------
To compile PortaBase for use as a Linux or UNIX desktop application for
a non-Debian-based distribution, you will need the following:
- g++ (any relatively recent version should work)
- A recent version of Qt 5 (including qmake and development headers)
- Other packages as needed to satisfy the above requirements or create
  packages for your OS/distribution

Metakit Compilation
-------------------
To compile PortaBase, Metakit (http://www.equi4.com/metakit/) must be compiled
first.  PortaBase uses a version of 2.4.9.8 patched to allow case-sensitive
searches and locale-sensitive sorting; the patched version is included in the
"metakit" directory for convenience (and to support the Debian and Maemo
autobuilders).

To compile Metakit for use in Linux desktop PortaBase, just follow the README
directions (the "UNIX" instructions); you'll want to pass the
"--enable-threads" and "--disable-shared" parameters to the configure script.

Help Pages Generation
---------------------
Make sure you have Python 2.4 or higher installed, as well as the "pip"
installer for Python packages.  Install Sphinx by running "pip install Sphinx"
as root or using sudo.  Also install the theme used by the PortaBase
documentation by running "pip install sphinx_rtd_theme".  Make sure you have
GNU gettext installed, since it's used to process the help file translations.
To be able to automatically download the latest help page translations from
Transifex, also run "pip install transifex-client". Use the script at
packaging/generate_help.sh to generate the help files; see the top of the
script for usage information.

PortaBase compilation
---------------------
- Set the QMAKESPEC and QTDIR environment variables as appropriate for your
  platform
- Make sure the Metakit static library (libmk4.a) is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
  and that the other library files (.so, .la, etc.) aren't.
- Run "lrelease resources/translations/*.ts" to prepare the translation files.
- Run qmake on portabase.pro
- Run make
