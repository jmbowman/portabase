Linux/UNIX Development Environment
----------------------------------
To compile PortaBase for use as a Linux or UNIX desktop application, you
will need the following:
- g++ (any relatively recent version should work)
- A recent version of Qt 4 (including qmake and development headers)
- Other packages as needed to satisfy the above requirements or create
  packages for your OS/distribution

Metakit Compilation
-------------------
To compile PortaBase, Metakit (http://www.equi4.com/metakit/) must be compiled
first.  PortaBase uses a version of 2.4.9.7 patched to allow case-sensitive
searches and locale-sensitive sorting; the patched version is included in the
"metakit" directory for convenience (and to support the Debian and Maemo
autobuilders).

To compile Metakit for use in Linux desktop PortaBase, just follow the README
directions (the "UNIX" instructions); you'll want to pass the
"--enable-threads" and "--disable-shared" parameters to the configure script.

Help Pages Generation
---------------------
Make sure you have Python 2.4 or higher installed, as well as the "pip"
installer for Python packages.  Install Sphinx by running "pip install Sphinx"
as root or using sudo.  To be able to automatically download the latest help
page translations from Transifex, also run "pip install transifex-client".
Use the script at packaging/generate_help.sh to generate the help files; see
the top of the script for usage information.

Debian Package Building
-----------------------
To create a Debian package for the desktop version of PortaBase, from the
root PortaBase source directory run "packaging/linux/debian.sh".  If you have
all the appropriate development packages installed, the .deb file will be
generated in the build/debian directory.

PortaBase compilation
---------------------
- Set the QMAKESPEC and QTDIR environment variables as appropriate for your
  platform
- Make sure the Metakit static library (libmk4.a) is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
  and that the other library files (.so, .la, etc.) aren't.
- Run "lrelease resources/translations/*.ts" to prepare the translation files.
- Run qmake on portabase.pro
- Run make
